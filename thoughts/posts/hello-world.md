# Hello, World

I've been meaning to write for a while. As an SRE, I spend most of my time building systems, debugging incidents, and automating away toil. Writing is a different kind of thinking — slower, more deliberate.

This space is for thoughts on infrastructure, reliability, AI/ML, and whatever else I find worth sharing.

More soon.
